problem may be with the keywords that being used to sort
-word is netpval
-check netpval 
    -netpval in 5 is different by an order of magnitude
    -6, 7, 8 , 9, 10-13
    
    before sorting:
        -11, 57, 71, 72, 86, 109
-check the first and last element of the sorted and unsorted 
- i am not sure if sort with a keyword is doing what i think?
or even what this code is doing
-use recursion to run check keys for the second dict on the first
